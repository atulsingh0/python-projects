### Check Input Type
This will give the user a message and ask him to return a value of a specified type (such as int, str, bool, float, etc...).  
If the user enters something that can't be cast to the appropriate type, an error is printed to the user and he's prompted to try again.  
Program will keep asking the data until a valid input is not given.
Program output will be as below - 


```
Enter the string data: 12
Wrong, You have entered Integer type. Try again. 
Enter the string data: True
Wrong, You have entered Boolean type. Try again.  
Enter the string data: abap
Correct, You did the job. 

Happy Learning !!!
